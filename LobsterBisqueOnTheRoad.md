## Lobster Bisque On The Road
When it comes to camp food, lobster bisque is probably not the first option you think of. However, lobster bisque is a delicious, warming comfort food that is perfect for eating by the campsite. It’s not as hard to make while on the road as you might think! Read on to learn how and why you should consider lobster bisque the next time you’re thinking up camping meals.

## Why it’s better than pre-cooked
Having lobster bisque for dinner while camping probably evokes images of using canned or dehydrated lobster bisque and simply heating it up. However, as is often the case with processed foods, they generally taste inferior to having the real thing freshly prepared. Believe it or not, lobster bisque is an excellent candidate for a campfire dinner. If you’re a lobster lover who can’t get enough of a good lobster bisque then read on to find out how you can make your own the next time you’re on the road.

## Preparing the ingredients
The most important ingredient in a lobster bisque is, naturally, the lobster itself. This should weigh around 1lb at least and, needless to say, it’s best to use fresh lobster. Lobster bisque does require a lot of ingredients that will need to be kept cool before you’re ready to use them, such as butter, cream and vegetables for the stock. Make sure you have some way of transporting and keeping your ingredients cool while you’re on the road, such as using a food cooler and/or freeze boards.

Lobster bisque requires lobster, chicken stock, tomato paste, butter, double cream, alcohol (white wine, sherry or brandy), all-purpose flour, and vegetables for stock such as carrots, celery, shallots, onions and garlic. Herbs and seasonings such as bay leaves, thyme, parsley and lemon juice are optional but will enhance the flavor. 

## Cooking by the campfire
Cooking lobster bisque by the campfire presents a fun challenge. You don’t have the luxury of tools and space that you have in a regular kitchen, so you have to adapt. It’s important to have a sturdy surface in order to be able to prepare the lobster and chop the veggies. Unless you’re experienced with preparing lobster, it’s likely you’ll make a bit of a mess while taking your lobster apart. The good news is that lobster pieces are completely biodegradable! However, be sure to observe local guidelines about food waste.

You’ll want a sharp knife in addition to a sturdy surface in order to prepare the lobster and the vegetables. Each recipe for lobster bisque is slightly different and they all come down to personal preference, so choose your favorite lobster bisque recipe to follow. For ours, we start by steaming (or boiling) the lobster and preparing the lobster meat. If you’re using whole lobster, be sure to preserve the head as you can break it down into rough chunks and add it to the stock base.

You can cook your lobster bisque over a campfire if you’re really feeling rustic, but we recommend using a portable gas stove because it’s much easier to control the heat than cooking over a fire. Depending on how many stovetops you have available, you might need to stagger the steps.

First, add the leftover lobster chunks to a pan of melted butter to start them cooking and then add the chopped vegetables and continue cooking until the onions become translucent. Add your alcohol to the pan (but watch out for potential flames!) and then cook the alcohol out. Add tomato paste and stir before adding all-purpose flour to thicken the sauce. Then add in your chicken stock in stages. Keep stirring and eventually, the combination of chicken stock and flour should start to thicken the sauce in your pan. Bring to a boil for about 30-40 minutes then lower the heat to a simmer for a further 45 minutes.

Strain the pieces, add cream and salt and season to taste. If you have a portable blender, you can further blend the soup. Otherwise, add your lobster meat chunks to the soup you have made and enjoy your freshly made campfire lobster bisque!

## Lobster bisque by the fire
Camping is fun but there’s no need to limit your options when it comes to food choices. If there’s no lobster bisque near you when you next go camping, why not try making it yourself? It’s not as difficult as you might think and you’ll be surprised at just how easy it can be to make while camping!
