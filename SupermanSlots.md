## Super Superman Slots\
What's that in the sky? Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's...Superman, the casino slot game! Fans of the world's first superhero and casino slot games will find a lot to like here, but stripped of its brand, is it worth your time? At its core, it's a slot game with 5 reels, 100 paylines and includes features such as a progressive jackpot, bonus games, free spins and multipliers. Those familiar with casino slot games will know all that's not too unusual compared to the competition, so how else does it stand out? Read on to find out if the Superman casino slot game is worth your time or not.\

## Feel Like a Superhero\
The Superman casino slot game leans heavily on its license, as you might imagine. Straight away the first thing you will notice is the orchestral Superman theme that starts as you play. It's a step above the sort of music you'd typically expect for a casino slot game and makes for a good first impression. It's the sort of music that won't annoy you after a while if you decide to leave it on, which is good.\

The next thing that will grab your attention is the free games and crystal bonus that it offers. Those playing for the first time are very welcome, and these bonuses range from free spins to multipliers and cash prizes. It's a game that wants you to keep playing, as you would expect, but it gives the player a lot back in return.\

The motif of the game is appropriately superheroic. You will be trying to match slot tiles based off infamous characters from Superman like Clark Kent and Lois Lane. Its wildcard slot design is the Superman logo, which lets you complete any line. Other slot tiles will grant you bonuses like free spins and random multipliers, which is much like many other casino slot game competitiors.\

Truthfully, Superman does not do much to stand out from the competition. It features the usual suite of features and bonuses, but apart from its licensed Superman design, there's not much here that you won't find in many other casino slot games. In fact, those bonuses are fairly standard and don't really have much in the way of unique or interesting mechanics. This Superman game is very by-the-book, which may be a good thing if you're a fan of Superman or you're just looking for a casino slot game to play and you don't care which one. Those looking for more, however, probably won't find much to keep them interested for long here.\

## Superman Falls Down to Earth\
Superman is technically a fine casino slot game. There's not much here to complain about. It contains all the standard features and bonuses that you'd expect from a modern casino slot game, but there it largely stops. It leans on its licensed design for its unique selling point, but there's not much more past its Superman design that sets it apart from the competition.\

Fans of casino slot games may find this game worth a look, if just for the sake of novelty and curiosity. It's a passable game, but it's not likely one that will hold your attention for long, unless you are a big Superman fan. There's nothing particularly bad here, but likewise there's not much that stands out and is worth talking about or praising. Take a look if you're bored and looking for new casino slot games to play, but otherwise Superman's casino slot game is a dud.
