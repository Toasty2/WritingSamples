## 10 Tips To Become A Successful Freelancer

Becoming a freelancer is a wonderful career path, one that over 50% of earning Gen-Z members have chosen. Since the onset of COVID, individuals across virtually all generations have made the switch to freelancing. We’re going to discuss five important tips for becoming a successful freelancer and doing it quickly.

1. Put your face out there
There’s nothing like being able to put a face to a name. It adds a human element to your interactions, as potential clients can see who they're talking to. Make sure to use a good picture too, one that is well lit and suitable for interacting with clients. Whether you choose a casual or professional dress style is left to choice. 

Investing in a good, high-quality webcam is important for a number of reasons:
- Clients commonly want to meet via Zoom and other platforms “face-to-face” before taking freelancers on. It’s far from every client you will encounter, but it’s quite common. 
- A faceless profile leads to a mental distance from the client you’re working for. It’s easier to see you as another human when they can see and hear you, instead of being a faceless voice in video meetings. 

2. Learn to frame your experience
One common struggle among freelancers is known as “imposter syndrome.” That basically means that people often feel like they aren’t successful or like they’re just fooling everyone around them. Sometimes, that goes away as they complete more contracts, but it’s not always easy to get rid of. 

You can set yourself up for success in preventing imposter syndrome while also improving your odds of closing clients. You need to look inside yourself and really take the time to feel through which skills you’ve developed expertise with, as opposed to those you only have experience with. 

Expertise doesn’t mean you’re a master at using that skillset. It just means you’ve dedicated a notable chunk of time to learning and practising that skill and the surrounding information.

3. Choose which skills you master—and what they’re worth
As a freelancer, you’ll quickly learn that your skills usually aren’t what you sell. You’re selling the fruits of your labor—whatever you make using your skills, you’re selling a solution to your client’s problems, fulfilment for their needs, or satisfaction for their wants. 

You, as a freelancer, get to choose what you want to do. Whether you want to serve as a remote call center technician, an accountant, or an architectural engineer, you can be a freelancer. Because you have chosen what skills to master, you can also set your own price. Sometimes, higher rates can mean less customers overall, but other times, higher rates can also secure higher quality customers.

Niche skills bring more to the table than general experience. Ultimately, our most limited resource is time. You will need to keep learning, refining, and reskilling, but stick to one or two areas of expertise to avoid spreading yourself too thin.

You determine what your time is worth. People need your services, so offer them on terms that work for you. 

4. Use tools to make your life easier
When you decide to make the switch, you’re going to have a lot of work coming at you from every direction. Keeping up client relationships, building new client relationships, managing deadlines for every project, keeping track of finished works that you need to deliver, invoicing clients to ensure you get paid, negotiating contracts, and many other tasks fall on your shoulders. 

There are tools for basically every task a freelancer may need to do.


- Communication Tools: Can help you ensure you have a reliable way to keep your clients up to date and often keep a log of what tasks, deliverables, revisions, or other promises you’ve made.
- Project Management Tools: These help you keep all of your clients’ projects on track for completion. They also help you ensure work is delivered on schedule.
- Bookkeeping or Invoicing Tools: These tools help you stay up-to-date on what money you’re owed, help you claim it from clients, and provide a clear record of your income and expenses.

Don’t overburden yourself with tools, as each one takes time to manage. Choose the most efficient ones for you. You can use this list of freelancing tools to pare out the great from the not-so-great.

5. Be your own boss—even when it’s not fun
You have to be your own boss. Sounds fun, right? It is! At least until you’re hit with a deadline out of nowhere. You’ll work diligently to keep your deadlines straight, but sometimes we forget, mislabel, misplace, or otherwise lose sight of a deadline. Being your own boss means making sure you put in the right amount of time to close out each job correctly.

Being your own boss is hard. There may be nobody to remind you about your to-do list. You may struggle to stay away from that “just-one-more-episode” Netflix series. It’s important to remember that you’re the only person who can keep you on track. It does get easier as you flex your discipline muscles, though.

6. Find the right freelance platform
Some freelance platforms are better suited than others to specific skill sets. If you’re a programmer, you will probably have better luck at platforms specifically targeted at developers, along with including a link to something like a Github profile. For more corporate or networking-based professions,, a profile on LinkedIn may be a better fit. There are dozens of different online platforms aimed at creatives, writers, musicians, developers and many more professions.

7. Build an attractive profile
Your profile is very likely to be looked at by any potential client. Beyond having your real name and face on your profile, you should include as much other information as possible. Social media links, references and basic bio information is expected, but it’s also your chance to display a bit of your own personality.

Wear as much of your personality on your sleeve as you feel comfortable. For freelancers, it’s often about standing out from the crowd, so don't be afraid to show off a bit of the other side of yourself when you’re not working.

8. Compile a portfolio
Your portfolio will need to include everything relevant to your profession that a prospective client would expect to see. This is highly dependent on your profession. For developers, this will often include links to completed projects or Github profiles with code samples. For artists and other creatives, this will include a portfolio of your work. 

Try to select your very best examples to show off on your profile. These are the works that you should be proud of and display what you can do for your potential clients. Try to provide various examples that showcase as many of your skills as possible.

9. Marketing your service
Getting work and being found all comes down to how your market yourself. Nobody else is going to toot your horn for you, so it’s up to you to market yourself. It can be easy to feel anxious or self-conscious about putting yourself out there, especially if you’re just starting out as a freelancer. However, the expression “fake it till you make it” has a lot of truth to it. Many freelancers learn on the job; after all, it’s the only way you’ll ever gain experience.

Don’t be shy or reluctant and do your best to network with people and make connections. You never know when somebody will be in need of your services, and the more people that know about you the better chances are of finding work.

10. How to close an offer
Once you receive some offers, it’s important to know how to close them. Particularly early on when your profile won’t have much feedback to rely on, giving clients confidence in hiring you is important. Act confident, but also stand firm on the nature of the contract. Be sure to be clear in what is expected of you, as well as all other relevant information such as project milestones and deadlines.

Be sure to respond promptly to all client enquiries and be clear about how much you will charge for your services. Not only does it help both you and the client to fully understand what is expected of both parties, but being professional and efficient in your communication helps provide the client with confidence.
