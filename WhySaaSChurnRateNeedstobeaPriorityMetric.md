## Why SaaS Churn Rate Needs to be a Priority Metric 

The SaaS model of software service delivery has become hugely successful over the last decade or so for a number of reasons. Customers can access the tools they need from almost anywhere with an Internet connection and they aren’t tied to any particular device. It’s also very convenient for customers to enter and exit subscriptions for different services without being tied down by lengthy contracts. However, this convenience for customers creates a problem for SaaS companies - how do you keep the customers you have? Churn in SaaS is a huge topic, with many different factors to consider. Read on to learn all about what SaaS churn rate is and why it should be a priority metric for you.


## What is Saas Churn? 

Measuring success and predicting growth relies on not only having good data but also tracking the right data. The metrics you choose to measure are just as important as the data you gather. Customer churn is one of the most important metrics for any SaaS platform. The churn rate refers to the amount of customers you lose over time - those who stop paying for your services. 

Customer churn, sometimes also known as customer attrition, is a normal part of business for a SaaS company but nevertheless, you want to keep it as low as possible. 

## What is the average churn rate?

It’s difficult to give a broadly applicable average churn rate, as it differs across industries, even within the context of SaaS companies. Your churn rate will never be zero, but as a rule of thumb, you want to keep it as close to zero as possible. A 2021 Private SaaS Company Survey found that the median churn as a percentage of annual recurring revenue was ~12%. However, there are many factors that can influence this.

In general, factors such as having a higher average revenue per unit and longer contracts correlate with lower churn rates. Freemium services tend to suffer from the highest churn rates. Likewise, older and more established companies tend to have lower churn rates than newer or funded companies.

## Steady, low-churn should be your aim. 

Ultimately, the aim of any SaaS platform should be to reduce your churn rate by as much as possible. The end goal should be a steady, low-churn rate, with more customers sticking than bouncing. This obviously provides a dependable revenue stream for your company, but sudden changes in churn rates can also indicate that something is going wrong. 

Spikes in churn rates and highly volatile changes to your SaaS churn rates are indicative of negative changes. Track your churn rates closely and compare them to software deployments - has something gone wrong in a recent update that your testers failed to catch? Was a new feature or price change negatively received by clients? Significant changes in churn rate, particularly in the wrong direction, are a cause for concern and should be immediately investigated.

## Why do SaaS companies ignore churn? 

For too many SaaS companies, the focus is on customer acquisition rather than customer retention. There are some people out there who even advocate for ignoring customer churn rates, but we feel this is a massive mistake. The arguments are that small, newer SaaS companies should not prioritize reducing churn and that SaaS software even has an inherent churn rate that is unavoidable.

The problem with these arguments is that there isn’t an easy way to determine which customers left due to ‘natural churn’ and which left for reasons that are completely within your control to prevent. While your churn rate will never be zero, you are leaving money on the table by writing off churn as inevitable or a growing pain when it may not be. 

Don’t obsess over churn rate to the point that it becomes your only metric of success, but definitely don’t undervalue it either. It should be a priority metric for your company for reasons that will be demonstrated below.

## How reducing churn impacts your bottom line. 

Let’s take a look at some equations to show exactly how reducing your churn rate can impact your bottom line.

Over time, small changes to your customer churn rate can have large effects on customer lifetime value (LTV). A study by Bain & Co found that as little as a 5% decrease in customer churn rate can result in boosting profits by up to 95% over time.

We can look at why this is the case by considering how customer LTV is calculated. Consider the following formula:

**Customer LTV** = (Customer revenue per year) x (number of years as a customer) – (total cost of acquiring and serving the customer)

As you can see, the number of years a customer stays with a company is multiplicative, while the costs of acquiring and serving them are not. Therefore, the longer that you can retain a customer, the more valuable and profitable they become, which increases exponentially over time.

An often over-looked factor with regards to customer loyalty is how loyal customers can often generate new business through referrals. Customers who are happy with a service are in turn more likely to refer others to your service. Your customer success team should be well aware of this, but it’s very much worth factoring in to your customer lifetime value.

##  Innovative ways to reduce churn 

Now that the value of reducing your churn rate has been established, your next question is no doubt likely to be how you can reduce your churn rate. This is not a simple one-step solution, but rather it will depend on many small changes and factors unique to your own SaaS solution. Below are some of the best generally applicable tips for helping to reduce your churn.

## Understand what customer success means for you

Customer success refers to strategies, methods and tactics used to help your customer achieve their goals and realize the value of your service. Essentially, you need to ask yourself why clients use your service. What are they trying to achieve? How does your SaaS solution help them to achieve their goals? Clients whose goals are not being met and clients who do not see value in your service are most likely to churn.

Customer success is about more than simply providing a service to clients. It’s about quantifying what success means for your customers, tracking the key metrics involved in customer success and delivering on those key metrics. If you don’t know what customer success means for your SaaS solution, then how can you help your customers to get the most out of your service? Having a robust customer success department is critical to understanding what customer success means for you and for your customers. Some top tips for customer success are listed below.

## Proactively listen to customers’ changing needs 

One of the many advantages of offering a SaaS solution is that it is an ever-evolving service. There is no point that it is ‘complete’ like the days of boxed software. Your customers will actively expect that development of your SaaS solution will continue, new features will be added and changes will be made over time.

Make sure to listen to your customers and respond to those changing needs. A significant churn factor comes from a mismatch between your SaaS services and your client’s expectations. You want to cast a wide net to appeal to as many customers as possible, but not every customer is going to be a good fit. You can reduce churn by being proactive about your customers’ needs, but don’t do so blindly. Not every customer will be a good fit and it’s important to calculate how much it will cost to develop requested features against how widely they will be used.

## Reduce onboarding time 

Customer onboarding is probably one of the biggest pain points of many SaaS platforms and a significant source of churn, as demonstrated by ABC. They found onboarding difficult for a number of reasons: if a customer needed help, it was hard to see exactly what the customer was doing wrong. There was a lot of time spent going back-and-forth trying to resolve issues, which was draining for both the client and support staff. There was a lot of wasted time, which ultimately led to not only customer churn, but also employee churn.

These long onboarding times and the associated problems led to ABC losing not only customers and therefore revenue, but also staff. XYZ was used to help solve this issue, by connecting clients and support staff directly through the browser. Both parties could see each other over a video feed and the support staff could see the client’s screen and take over with their permission. This drastically cut down on the confusion and frustration felt by both clients and support staff, which in turn led to a 3x faster average onboarding time, higher customer satisfaction and higher customer retention.

## Develop a personal connection with your clients

SaaS solutions often simply involve your client interacting with your service through a web browser. It’s very hard to develop a connection to your client in these situations and clients can often feel very disconnected from your company. Difficulty in finding support when they need it, long response times, and canned responses from support staff can all lead to clients feeling sidelined and unvalued.

It’s very difficult to establish a personal connection with clients when their only interaction with you may be through your SaaS platform, but with a tool like XYZ, you can do just that. XYZ allows your support staff and clients to interact via a video feed in the corner of your website or app. Clients and staff can physically see and hear each other, creating a personal connection that goes beyond simple text-based communication. It’s well established that face-to-face communication is better than text, but it may surprise you to learn that studies have shown face-to-face requests are 34x times more successful than emails!

Of course, it’s not always practical to have human support staff available 24/7 to answer your customers. SaaS platforms have the ability to serve customers from around the world at any hour of the day, but this does not mean you necessarily have the support staff in place to accommodate this. In these cases, consider implementing chatbots.

The benefits of chatbots are numerous. They can serve customers quickly and automatically at any time of day, they cut down on the amount of live support staff required to handle customer requests, and some customers straight up prefer using a chatbot than talking to a live service agent.

There’s no reason you can’t have both live service agents and chatbots implemented as part of your SaaS solution. They serve customers in slightly different ways but they both help to address customer concerns and provide more immediate feedback than making a customer fill out a request form or write an email.

## Using your customer success department to decrease churn. 

Decreasing your churn rate should be one of the goals of every SaaS company. By now it should be well-established why reducing your churn rate is important and one of the best ways of doing this is through your customer success department.

As mentioned above, your customer success department should be focused on delivering value for your clients. Clients should get more value out of using your service than they pay to use it. For many companies, your SaaS solution will form part of their workflow. We can think of your client’s needs in simple business terms using the following formula:

**Customer Value** = (Total Customer Benefits - Total Customer Costs)

Your service must provide for your customers a positive customer value. If it costs your clients more to use your service than the benefits they receive, they will churn and go elsewhere. Key to this is quantifying and valuing customer benefits, which will vary greatly from industry to industry, as well as from customer to customer. There are several ways you can quantify the benefits of your service, but these generally fall into either generating more money for your clients or reducing costs for your clients.

## Using your churn rate to improve overall company operations. 

Your churn rate is a good litmus test of how connected your customers feel to your platform. If you have a high churn rate, it’s a good indication that something is majorly wrong. Why are your customers leaving? The answer is likely either that they do not feel valued as a customer or they do not see sufficient value in using your service.

## Metrics to track to determine churn and retention rate

Churn rate can be tracked through a few different metrics. The most commonly used formula for calculating churn rates is subscription churn, which is the following:

**Subscription churn** = Cancellations within a certain period / subscriptions at the beginning of the period

This is a very simple churn formula, but it gives you the percentage of customers that were lost to churn over a given period of time. What’s most relevant here is that new subscriptions are not factored in - you are only measuring how many existing subscriptions you lost in a period as a percentage. 

Another commonly used churn formula is as follows:

**Gross revenue churn** = revenue lost within a certain period / revenue at the beginning of the period

Rather than measuring subscriptions, this metric tracks how much revenue has been lost within a given period. It works in much the same way as subscription churn and also does not account for newly generated revenue, but it does provide a monetary figure for how much revenue has been lost in a given period to churn.

The last, and perhaps best, formula for tracking churn is:

**Net revenue churn** = (revenue lost in a given period - upsells) / revenue at the beginning of the period

This is a more accurate metric as it accounts for upsells and additional revenue generated during a particular period. This provides the net revenue generated, which provides the most accurate insight into revenue generation and money gained or lost. 

If the figure you arrive at is positive, it means that you are losing more money from lost subscriptions than you are earning from upselling. This means you need to be bringing in more new subscriptions than you are losing to remain profitable.

If your figure is 0 or close to it, it means that lost revenue and upsells are cancelling each other out. You’re not losing money, but you’re not gaining money, either. You are still dependent on new subscriptions coming in for profit.

The most desirable case is if the figure you arrive at is negative. This means that you’re generating more revenue from upsells than you are losing from lost subscriptions. Congratulations to you! This means that you are generating a profit even without accounting for new subscriptions.

## Don’t beat yourself up over unavoidable churn 

As previously established, your churn rate will never be zero. It’s important to understand this, rather than go chasing rainbows. Reducing your churn rate is an important goal, but a certain amount of churn is unavoidable. Probably the most significant instance of unavoidable churn is your customer going out of business. This happens and is a natural part of business, but it’s completely out of your hands, so don’t sweat it.

There are also cases where there is a mismatch between the customer’s expectations and what your software offers for which there is no compromise. A customer may expect certain features or to have things done a certain way that your SaaS product does not offer. In these cases, it’s helpful to use the formula above to calculate a customer’s lifetime value. This should be compared against the cost of what it would take to develop the features they desire. If it’s not profitable, then it’s not worth spending excess money developing features in an attempt to retain such a customer.

## What you can learn from unavoidable churn. 

Even though customer churn is unavoidable, you should still be doing as much as you can to understand why those customers leave. In particular, there may be some common threads between them that you can learn from and improve. For example, you may find that over time you are slowly but consistently losing customers over a desire for similar features. Developing bespoke features for a single client may not be profitable, but if you’re slowly losing customers over time over the same lack of features, then cumulatively it may be worth your while to develop said features. Without closely monitoring the reasons behind your churn rate, there’s no way for you to know and you could be losing revenue unnecessarily.

## We love seeing clients decrease churn by meeting customers where they are when they are there. 

Hopefully, by now it should be clear why your churn rate is an important metric to track and how you can help reduce it. One of the best ways of doing this is by meeting your clients face-to-face and establishing a personal connection as early into the customer relationship as possible.

It’s not feasible to meet all your clients face-to-face in-person, but you can meet them face-to-face online with a service like XYZ. Particularly in a post-pandemic world where business travel is still not as frequent or common as it used to be, being able to have face-to-face discussions with your clients can mean the difference between securing a customer and losing them to churn.
