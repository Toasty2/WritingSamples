node.js has become the ubiquitous tool for Javascript web development and virtually any technology written in Javascript for the web these days will use node.js in some way. Whether that's fulling implementing it within a project's technology stack or simply using it locally to compile stylesheets, node.js has become a cornerstone of the Javascript eco-system. Its versatility of use and huge community behind it make it indispensable for the modern Javascript developer and it's virtually a requirement to be at least somewhat familiar with it these days. If you're not, then read on to find out why you should consider taking a node js course.\

## What is node.js?
node.js is a Javascript runtime environment. What this means is that it was built as a standalone application that runs on your machine and functions like a server, while traditionally Javascript was considered a client side language with script that executed in your browser. This means it can be used to power the server side backend technology of a website, while also being used to run tasks and provide the backbone for frontend development. Using one language for both server side and client side software brings huge benefits, as a unified language no longer silos developers into 'client side' or 'server side'. Teams can work much more efficiently and everyone on the project is able to work in a single consistent language.\

While the benefits of node.js for teams are many, it's also useful for solo developers or developers who don't want to fully integrate it into their existing technology stack. node.js can also be used exclusively to assist with local development. Virtually every Javascript library written these days will include a release on the npm, including some libraries that must be installed using the npm.\

## What is the npm?
npm stands for Node Package Manager and functions as the largest Javascript software registry. Virtually every Javascript library written these days can be downloaded and integrated into your project straight from the npm. Using the npm has several advantages over simply copying the relevant files into your project - it can be used to keep track of your dependencies, update them when new releases are pushed and allows for nimbler project distribution and deployment.\

node.js and npm can be scripted to download external packages as part of the deployment process, meaning you don't have to include your project dependencies directly into your code base. This saves space and, in conjunction with version control software, makes it much easier for new developers to get a copy of a project and get started.\

## Why is node.js worth learning?
Plenty of other languages are used for web development, but they require running on external servers, while Javascript runs in the browser and thus is installed on every client machine. It's fast, thanks to the powerful V8 engine, and has a huge community of developers powering it, which only continues to grow as Javascript becomes the de facto programming language of the web.\

node.js developers are therefore in high demand and it's a role with very varied possibilities. As node.js is used for just about everything, you could get a job as a node.js developer to create websites, write tool chain software or develop server side applications. There is a lot of variety in node.js jobs, so if you're looking to begin a career in modern software development, taking a node js course is a great way to get started.\

## What sort of node.js courses are available?
As node.js is such a versatile language with a range of uses within a project and a vast community backing it, there are a lot of topics to cover. Courses can range from a complete overview of node.js and how it fits into the development eco-system to courses that focus exlusively on one facet of node.js, such as how to use npm or different elements of the node.js core.\

Plenty of projects are built on top of node.js in some way, so it makes sense to take a node js course even if you aren't intending to explicitly become a node.js developer.
