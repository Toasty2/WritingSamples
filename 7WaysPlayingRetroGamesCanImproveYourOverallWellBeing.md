## 7 Ways Playing Retro Games Can Improve Your Overall Well Being
When it comes to relaxing and unwinding, video games make a great choice. Whether you like online competitive multiplayer games or meditative single-player experiences, there is a huge variety of choices when it comes to choosing a video game to play. In this article, we’re going to take a look at 7 reasons why playing retro games in particular can help to improve your overall well being.

1.	They improve hand-eye coordination
It’s well established that video games can help improve your hand-eye coordination. Intuitively, this makes sense, as gamers need to manipulate a controller with their hands while looking up at a screen. These improvements are not insignificant either - research has shown surgeons who play video games perform better at surgeries than surgeons who don’t!

You might think that modern, fast-paced competitive games like Call of Duty or Fortnite would be a good choice for this, but many of these online games require significant time (and sometimes financial) investments in order to remain competitive. Meanwhile, retro games such as Battletoads or Ghouls and Goblins offer a hard-as-nails challenge that you can pick up and put down at your leisure

2.	They provide a distraction
Though this psychological trick isn’t unique to video games, they are a great way to take your mind off real life. Video games are arguably one of the greatest forms of escapism, as they are interactive. Many video games put you in the role of the hero and give you great agency in how you wish to achieve your goals. A lot of games allow you to create your own custom characters, allowing you to escape and immerse yourself even further in the world.

3.	They provide a sense of community
Online games in particular took off in a big way in the past year, thanks to global lockdowns last year that restricted social gatherings for many. Plenty of popular modern games, such as Animal Crossing, Fortnite and Pokémon Go, have built-in social elements that help players feel connected. However, there are just as many communities built around retro games and many of these communities have been running for years. Virtually every popular retro game will have a community forum or Facebook page with a thriving, active community to engage with.

Nowadays it’s even possible to play many retro games online, such as spider solitaire online. These websites may or may not sync up to online leaderboards or other communities to allow you to play these traditionally single-player games competitively against others in a low-stress environment at your leisure.

4.	They challenge us to try harder
Video games often provide a challenge to the player in the form of hurdles that they must overcome. These challenges can come in the form of puzzles that must be solved, daily events that need to be completed sequentially or challenges that require the player to master the intricacies of the game. Some games, like Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts or Ninja Gaiden, even embrace this and build their game around being intentionally difficult. These challenges teach players to persist and reward endurance, valuable skills for both video games and life in general.

5.	They help improve our vision
This may come as a surprise to some gamers who were warned that they would end up with square vision if they stared at the TV for too long, but playing video games can actually help improve vision for people with visual impairments! Studies have shown that people with cataracts showed improvements in their vision after playing certain video games that require quick reflexes. It’s believed this is due to the fact that these games require an extreme amount of attention from players because they are fast-paced and require players to identify threats quickly.

6.	They provide pain relief
Believe it or not, video games have been shown to provide pain relief. Not in the form of a distraction or escapism, but as a mild form of literal pain relief. Playing video games can cause the brain to release endorphins, the feel-good chemicals that provide pain relief and make us feel happy. This is the same effect as what happens when people exercise and what is often described as the “runner’s high”.

7.	They keep your brain sharp
It was Dr Kawashima’s Brain Training for the Nintendo DS that made the case for puzzle games helping people keep their brains active - particularly the elderly and people at risk of dementia and memory loss. However, there are plenty of retro puzzle games to choose from and they all meet the same basic criteria for keeping your brain sharp -  these games provide challenges in the form of memory tests, mathematical puzzles and logic challenges. There is scientific evidence backing the premise that playing these types of games regularly helps prevent a decline in mental acuity.

## Conclusion
Far from being the time-waster many people once viewed video games as, there is a growing body of evidence that playing games can have a positive impact on our overall well being. Retro games, in particular, provide a sweet spot of ease of use, fun, and challenge without being overbearing or requiring too large a time investment to reap the rewards.
