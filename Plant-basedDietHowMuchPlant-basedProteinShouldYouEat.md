## Plant-based Diet: How Much Plant-based Protein Should You Eat and How Common Is Protein Deficiency?
A very common question among vegetarians and vegans concerned about their nutritional intake is: how much protein should I be eating? People who are active, exercise a lot or are looking to build muscle in particular need protein, but how much is enough and what is the best way to make sure you’re getting enough protein on a plant-based diet? In this article, we’ll answer some of the most common questions about protein and plant-based diets, as well as give suggestions for some excellent sources of plant-based protein.

## How much protein do I actually need?
High protein and added protein foods have become a somewhat common sight on supermarket shelves in recent years. These products often claim to have additional protein added to them, which is usually in the form of plant-based protein. This makes it cheaper for manufacturers to include, but oftentimes it also means this additional protein is suitable for vegans! That’s the good news, but how much protein do you actually need in your daily diet? 

Sources vary on how much protein is necessary, with US government guidelines currently at 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. The WHO, meanwhile, recommends 0.66 grams per kilogram. The exact answer depends on a number of factors, such as your age, gender, and level of activity. Someone who lifts heavy weights and is looking to build muscle should consume more protein, in the range of 1.3 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.

## What is the correct proportion of protein for my diet?
Your protein intake should be considered within the wider scope of your overall diet. It is recommended that, proportionally, protein makes up between 10-15% of your overall daily caloric intake. For an average adult man, this works out to around 63 grams of protein per day and 52 grams for an average adult woman. This could go as high as over 100 grams of protein a day at the extreme end, such as for endurance athletes and bodybuilders. 

It’s totally possible to achieve these numbers on a plant-based diet. In fact, it’s estimated that, on average, vegetarians and vegans get 70% more protein than necessary in their daily diet. This figure is even higher for non-vegetarians, who consume almost 80% more protein than the recommended amount in their daily diet. Even for those looking to consume 100 grams of plant-based protein in a day, it shouldn’t be a very difficult target to reach if you are including several high-protein foods in your meals.

## What are the best sources of plant-based protein?
The good news is that there are plenty of good sources of plant-based protein for those on plant-based diets. Below is a selection of just some of the many choices available to vegetarians and vegans.

## Tofu
Soy products are some of the best sources of plant-based proteins. Soy comes in many different forms, including soy sauce and edamame. We’ve chosen to highlight tofu in particular due to its versatility, which makes it something you can have for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even dessert.

Tofu’s versatility is due to its different types of firmness. This simply refers to how much water it has absorbed. The more water it absorbs, the softer and silkier the texture becomes. Silken tofu is the softest tofu and is commonly used in dessert dishes. By contrast, super firm is often used as a meat substitute in dishes, due to the texture and ‘bite’ it has to it. Super firm is the firmest tofu, but it’s less common than regular or firm tofu, which are simply tofus of firmness somewhere in between super firm and silken.

## Nuts
Nuts are a very nutritious food, being generally high in fat and protein. There’s plenty of variety too, from peanuts to walnuts, cashews, pecans, pistachios and plenty more. There’s also an almost endless variety of ways to prepare and eat them, from nut butter to nut milk, added to desserts, mains, eaten on their own or as part of a trail mix and many, many more. They’re also typically high in calories too, so it’s important to be mindful of how much you are eating, but nut-based products can be a great substitute for dairy and meats.

## Buckwheat
Buckwheat, despite its name, is not a wheat at all, but rather a seed. Buckwheat is common in eastern Europe and it’s great as a side dish or alternative to oats. It can be eaten on its own or added as a side to a dish used in much the same way as rice. Buckwheat can be eaten directly as a grain, or it can be prepared and made into other popular dishes that use buckwheat flour, such as buckwheat noodles.

Buckwheat noodles are popular in Japan where they are known as soba noodles. It’s a popular and delicious dish in restaurants that has the added benefit of also being gluten-free, so if you’re a coeliac who loves noodles then buckwheat could be a good choice for you.

## Quinoa
Quinoa is another high-protein, gluten-free alternative to grains like wheat and rice. Much like buckwheat, quinoa isn’t actually a grain itself, but a seed. However, it is high in protein and is a complete protein, which means it contains all nine essential amino acids. It’s a very versatile food that can be eaten on the side or prepared as the main ingredient in a dish. It’s absorbent, so it can easily take in the flavors of many different kinds of dishes that it’s cooked with.  

## How common is protein deficiency?
There’s no doubt that, in recent decades, people have become more mindful of what they are eating and how nutritious their diet is. Fast food menus now regularly contain salads and other ‘healthy’ options, and sugar-free and sugar-alternative sodas are now common sights on supermarket shelves. People are more interested in what they eat and what the food they eat contains.

One common concern for vegetarians and vegans alike is whether they are getting enough protein in their diet. It’s a common misconception that meat is the best source of protein, and therefore people who do not eat meat are at risk of protein deficiency. The truth is that protein deficiency is very uncommon for both plant-based diets and non-vegetarian diets alike. Even without intentionally trying, most people get more than the recommended amount of protein from their daily diet. Protein deficiency is rarely seen outside of those suffering from an overall calorie intake deficiency. Even in this case, the answer would be to simply consume more calories, rather than specifically worry about how many of those calories are coming from protein.

## Choosing a diet that works for you
The most important aspect of any diet is how much you enjoy it. There’s no point picking the most protein-dense foods you can find if you don’t like them, as you’re not likely to last long if you’re making yourself eat foods you don’t like. There are many varied sources of high-quality protein that are available to those on plant-based diets, so shop around and try to prepare all sorts of different meals and snacks with them to find the foods that work for you.
